# CSS Flexbox Photo Gallery

This project showcases a simple and responsive photo gallery built using HTML and CSS Flexbox. The gallery is designed to be clean and modern, making it a perfect example of how to create visually appealing layouts with Flexbox.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The gallery adapts to various screen sizes, displaying images in a flexible grid.
- **Flexbox Design**: Utilizes Flexbox for easy alignment and distribution of image elements, ensuring that the layout is fluid and dynamic.
- **Image Styling**: Each image is styled to maintain consistent proportions, rounded corners, and a smooth appearance with `object-fit: cover`.
- **Modern Aesthetics**: A minimalistic and sleek design, with a dark header and soft background for a professional and clean look.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the photo gallery.
- **CSS**: Styling for the layout, including Flexbox for responsiveness and design.
  
## How It Works

The gallery's layout uses Flexbox to arrange the images in rows, wrapping to the next line when necessary. The images are sized to maintain uniformity and create a visually appealing grid. The header section has a bold, uppercase title with a contrasting background color to make it stand out.
